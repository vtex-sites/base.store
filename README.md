  A store theme powered by VTEX and Gatsby
</h1> 

Kick-off your project with this default boilerplate. This starter ships with the main VTEX Store configuration files you might need to get up and running blazing fast with the blazing-fast store for React. 

## 🚀 Quick start

0. **Clone this repo**

    Get up and running by cloning this repo.

    ```shell
    # Clone this repo into your machine
    npx degit vtex-sites/storecomponents.store my-awesome-store
    ```

1.  **Install dependencies**

    Install dependencies with yarn

    ```shell
    cd my-awesome-store/
    yarn
    ```

2.  **Setup env vars.**

    Chose a store by changing the `vtex.env` file and adding your own custom account name.

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-awesome-store` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real-time!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── .eslintrc.js
    ├── gatsby-browser.js
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── gatsby-node.js
    ├── gatsby-ssr.js
    ├── LICENSE
    └── yarn.lock
    ├── package.json
    ├── tsconfig.json
    ├── vtex.env
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for “source code”.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`.eslintrc.js`**: This is a configuration file for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/). ESlint is a tool to find and fix problems in your JavaScript code.

6.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

7.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

8.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

9. **`yarn.lock`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

10. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

11. **`tsconfig.json`**: The configuration file for the typescript compiler. This will statically analyze your code for errors and bugs before releasing them into production

12. **`vtex.env`**: Environment variables needed for accessing your account in VTEX

13. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## 🎓 Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on their website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with Gatsby's [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to Gatsby's documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.

## ⚡ Performance
This project uses Google's Lighthouse CI for analyzing the store's performance and setting performance budgets. The URLs tested can be found and changed in the `ci.collect.url` property. Feel free to change this at your will
